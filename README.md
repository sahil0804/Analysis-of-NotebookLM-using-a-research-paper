As a consultant, I have evaluated NotebookLM, an experimental tool by Google designed to leverage language models and existing content to deliver personalized learning and insights. This report assesses the potential of NotebookLM for use in a university setting by examining its functionalities, providing practical demonstrations, and offering a critical analysis of its strengths and weaknesses.
Here’s how each functionality can practically support financial analysis using the TOPSIS method:

**Summarization of Financial Reports and Insights Extraction**
Example: When I uploaded the annual financial reports of ten pharmaceutical companies, NotebookLM can summarize key financial highlights such as net profit, debt-to-equity ratio, and total assets. This allows me to focus on relevant metrics for TOPSIS analysis without combing through each report.
**Question Answering for Specific Financial Metrics**
Example: A student may ask, “What was Sun Pharmaceuticals' return on assets during FY 2020-21?” or “Which company had the highest current ratio in the post-COVID period?” NotebookLM provides direct answers based on the uploaded reports, assisting in identifying critical financial metrics needed for TOPSIS ranking.
**Customizable Study Guides for Financial Concepts and Methods**
Example: NotebookLM can create a study guide that outlines key financial ratios used in the analysis (e.g., current ratio, net profit margin, asset turnover) and explains the TOPSIS methodology step-by-step. This can aid students in both understanding and applying the TOPSIS approach to financial ranking.
**Cross-Referencing for Comparative Analysis**
Example: By uploading financial reports from multiple years or from different companies, NotebookLM can highlight changes in financial ratios over time or differences between companies. This cross-referencing supports the comparative analysis required to assess which companies performed best, as TOPSIS requires a comparative ranking.
**Critical Analysis of Each Capability**

**Summarization of Financial Reports and Insights Extraction**
Accuracy: Summarization is generally accurate in capturing key financial metrics but may occasionally overlook nuanced financial indicators.
Effectiveness: Effective for extracting essential information quickly, allowing students to focus on core metrics.
Strengths: Reduces time spent reviewing detailed reports, making it easier to identify metrics for the TOPSIS analysis.
Weaknesses: May omit subtle details about financial performance that could affect analysis accuracy, especially if important metrics are not immediately recognized as key points.

**Question Answering for Specific Financial Metrics**
Accuracy: Provides accurate answers for straightforward questions; however, responses can be affected by how well the content is structured.
Effectiveness: Offers immediate clarity on specific metrics, enhancing efficiency for TOPSIS-related analysis.
Strengths: Direct access to specific metrics allows students to retrieve necessary information without extensive searching, useful for quick, targeted inquiries.
Weaknesses: Misinterpretation may occur with ambiguous questions, potentially impacting the accuracy of the data used in the TOPSIS model.

**Customizable Study Guides for Financial Concepts and Methods**
Accuracy: Guides are accurate when explaining basic financial concepts and methodologies like TOPSIS, though sometimes oversimplified for advanced users.
Effectiveness: Effective for students who need structured learning materials and step-by-step guides for financial analysis.
Strengths: Helps students grasp complex methods by breaking down TOPSIS and financial metrics into manageable concepts.
Weaknesses: May oversimplify or miss more advanced applications of financial analysis, requiring students to verify the completeness of the guide.

**Cross-Referencing for Comparative Analysis**
Accuracy: Effective at identifying broad trends and key comparisons between documents but may overlook subtler patterns.
Effectiveness: Supports comparative insights, essential for ranking in TOPSIS, by aligning metrics across multiple companies or time frames.
Strengths: Facilitates pattern recognition across datasets, aiding students in drawing connections and making comparisons for financial ranking.
Weaknesses: Limited in handling complex relationships or dependencies between financial metrics, which may be crucial for accurate rankings.

**Evidence-Based Reflections**
NotebookLM has clear potential for supporting financial analysis with the TOPSIS method. However, to maximize its utility, students and faculty should:

Cross-Verify Key Metrics: While NotebookLM can accurately extract metrics, verification is recommended to ensure accurate inputs for TOPSIS.
Provide Structured Content: Content should be clearly organized to help NotebookLM accurately extract relevant financial details and avoid missing critical metrics.
Use Guided Methodology: Faculty might consider guiding students on how to use NotebookLM’s functionalities for structured approaches like TOPSIS, especially in identifying and normalizing the criteria required for ranking.
Conclusion
NotebookLM shows promising functionality for financial analysis using the TOPSIS method, providing capabilities that enhance summarization, metric retrieval, conceptual understanding, and comparative analysis. However, to fully leverage NotebookLM, the university should incorporate verification practices, training sessions, and structured content preparation, ensuring accuracy and reliability in financial analysis for educational purposes.
